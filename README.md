This repo is build with the purpose of providing and maintaining some code examples & solutions as an illustration & extension of the Cloud Design Patterns project, maintained by [Microsoft patterns & practices](https://github.com/mspnp) Team. 

A more detailed list of reasons for this project is as follows:
- **As requested.** More and more frequently I am being asked to comment and validate in various official ways and uses of design & development patterns for the cloud. This is an attempt to collect and maintain a repo of knowledge and assets to best do this.   
-  **tl;dr or Less .ppt; More code.** Most of what I do, in terms of coaching and dev support, flows through chalktalk sessions with plenty of information in Powerpoint slides. While that is unavoidable and necessary, I would also back it up with some complete code projects and meaningful solutions.
- **Is already old.** There are plenty of pages and projects and books outthere, describing in excruciating details on what dev & design patterns are. And I will not hide the fact that this is yet-another-design-patterns-repo {chuckles}. But as everything else in the world of computing, they get stale and outdated very quickly. This project might suffer from the same in no time {worrisome and guilty}. However, since this is the code that I use frequently in various projects, I am hoping to periodically come back here and update it often.
-    **No code samples; meaningful solutions.** Most books and web pages and projects about development patterns, are always accompanied by code snippets and samples to illustrate what the book or test describe. There is nothing wrong with that. Actually that is best; you dot want to be overloaded by code while you learn. But I wanted more. I wanted not to learn by reading books, but rather by writing code. And that code to be meaningful, complete and ready to be part of a larger solution. This is the intent behind the code in this repo: complete code, complete solution, with applied patterns and best-practices, and ready to be part of a larger solution. 
- **More**. There are more reasons, but no time to write them all down. Let the code speak for itself.
